**What is Web**

*A collection of related Web pages, images, videos or other digital assets that are addressed relative to a common Uniform Resource Locator (URL), often consisting of only the domain name, or the IP address, and the root path in an Internet Protocol-based network.*

- *Basically a set of files, stored on the WWW*
- *Hosted in 1+ web server*
- *Accessible via the Internet (public) or private network, in the form of URL*
- *Viewed with a browser like Chrome*
- *Each website has a home page (main page)*
- *The protocol called HTTP is used to load web pages when someone want to access with an URL*

**4 types**

1. Personal

- Keep in touch
- Seek jobs
- Express himself

2. Business

- Promote
- Publish (products or services to target audience)
- No extra cost like printing media
- Up to date

3. Organizational

- Government or non-profit org
- Promote causes like edu, social issues, health
- E.g: University webpage

4. Entertainment

**Internet**

- Websites store information that is connected & shared
- They have Internet protocol (IP) - a set of standards - to address and route data
- Other protocol cannot easily link 1 doc to another like IP
- Like from Google search results

**Fundamentals of web**

- HTML: describe how a page/text should be formatted
- Web browser: to access web pages from web server, like Chrome
- You use HTTP to make a request to access files that are stored in the web server, it will collect and assembles files from the servers into one page

**Static vs Dynamic websites**

- **Static:** coded in HTML, remain the same to different users or times, manually changed if needed
- **Dynamic:** changed to different users or times, like news

**History and Development**

- 1989: Tim Berners-Lee invented WWW at CERN
- First usage: *automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world...that used a hypertext process to link related documents over a network.*
- 1992: only 50 servers; introduce NCSA Mosaic - the first graphical browser (no longer text-only)
- Later: Web 2.0 and 3.0
- 1994: Tim Berners-Lee founded W3C - a common standards for WWW, at MIT

**Where to start, what web designer do**

- Classes, projects, practice
- Graphic design, UX design, doc markup, write, info architecture, PTS...

**HTML Multimedia**

- Sound, music, videos, movies, animations
- Multimedia: text, color, fonts, images
- Video format: mp4, webm, ogg -> supported by HTML
- Video tag: <video>, <source>, <track>
- Audio format: mp3, wav, ogg
- Audio tag: <audio>, <source>
- Plug-ins: <object> (Java applets, PDf reader, Flash player), <embed>, youtube <iframe>

# Chap 2: Intro to Flash

**Intro to Flash**

- Flash can be used to create games, presentations, animations, visualizations, interactive apps
- When animate with ActionScript, you need to know Flash well

**History**

- FutureWave company built styluses to draw on SmartSketch - a vector graphics program, and the program became popular on Windows and macOS, due to its **lightweightness & scalability**
- Later they built FutureSplash Animator to add motion capabilities *=> you could author your content using this program and play back the content through a web browser using a plugin.*
- CSS & JS did not exist yet, which means you have to install browser plugin to have rich media experience.
- 1996: FlashPlayer extension was born to solve it (=Future + Splash), when Macromedia acquired FutureWave
- Macromedia then built ActionScript, an OOP language
- 2005: Adobe acquired Macromedia -> Animate

**Why Flash (or Animate)?**

- Scalable, Interactive
- No programming skilled required
- Easy to learn
- Macromedia: "a competitor to HTML to build interactive web"
- Vector-based
- Faster loaded

**Adobe Animate**

- Panels to know: Stage, Tools, Timeline, Properties, Library, Assets
- Learn more on Youtube

#Chap 3-9: It's all about learning Adobe Animate, it'd be better to learn on Youtube
